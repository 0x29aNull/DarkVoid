# DarkVoid: A weekly blog on Void Linux for nefarious uses.

## About DarkVoid
Void Linux is a 'General Purpose' GNU/Linux Operating System. It uses runit
as an init system and muslc (glibc versions are available), which makes for
a lightning fast system. After the initial install you're left with a bare
bones Linux distribution which is very pliable. I believe that fragmenting
distros for single uses (ie. pentesting) is only making the Linux community
more of a hostile environment to new users. This blog is dedicated to turning
my favorite Linux distribution in to anything you want. A dedicated hacking
box, a media streaming pirate server, an OSINT information gathering system,
and much more. If you have any questions please reach out to me [0x29a@null.net](0x29a@null.net).
