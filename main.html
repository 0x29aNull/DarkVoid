<h2 id="about-darkvoid">About DarkVoid</h2>
<p>Void Linux is a &#39;General Purpose&#39; GNU/Linux Operating System. It uses runit
as an init system and muslc (glibc versions are available), which makes for
a lightning fast system. After the initial install you&#39;re left with a bare
bones Linux distribution which is very pliable. I believe that fragmenting
distros for single uses (ie. pentesting) is only making the Linux community
more of a hostile environment to new users. This blog is dedicated to turning
my favorite Linux distribution in to anything you want. A dedicated hacking
box, a media streaming pirate server, an OSINT information gathering system,
and much more. If you have any questions please reach out to me <a href="0x29a@null.net">0x29a@null.net</a>.</p>
